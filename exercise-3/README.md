# Exercise-2

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# Adding files to staging 
``` git add . ``` 
_this adds all the new files to the staging git_ 

# Commiting files to git 
``` git commit -m "comment"```
_this commit the staging to actual git (on your computer)_

# Pushing files to github 
``` git push ``` 
_this pushes the file on your computer to github. You can see the updated files on github account._
